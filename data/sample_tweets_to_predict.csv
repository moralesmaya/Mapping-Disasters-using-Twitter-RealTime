VORTEXJeff,2021-02-14 23:59:39+00:00,"This should be the biggest snowstorm in years in Champaign-Urbana, although that's not saying much. We haven't had 6""+ since 2015. Here's a look at some of the recent big ones here. Snow was measured at 8am CT, so much of the snowfall could have occurred on the previous day"

We had multiple offers on the house off of one week of showings, even with the snow storm. Seven of the offers were all over asking price."

MrsCarterWrites,2021-02-14 23:58:46+00:00,"Pretty often, I get all dreamy about moving to the Pacific Northwest. But then (once every 2-3 years) we get a random ice/snow storm in AL with highs in the 30s for a couple of days, and I remember how much of an utter cold-weather-wimp I am. https://t.co/PRco5hO6ho"
